# Easy
# Given an integer array nums, 
# find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# Example:
# Input: 
# [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 
# 6
# Explanation: 
# [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

# Follow up:
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, 
# try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, 
# which is more subtle.

# Solution
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = float('-inf')
        temp = float('-inf')
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            temp = max(nums[i], temp + nums[i])
            if temp > res:
                res = temp
        return res
# TC: O(n); SC: O(1)
# Success
